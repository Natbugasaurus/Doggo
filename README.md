Dog's Breakfast by Nathaniel Bott (S3605944) and Alex Leheny (S3659192)
Version control:

Inspired by Cooking Mama, Dog's Breakfast is all about helping your doggo pal to create some bread. It can be played singleplayer or multiplayer
and takes you through a number of small playful minigames about the wonder of attempting to bake with paws.

# Controls (tested with keyboard and Xbox one controller via USB):
Left Paw - Left trigger or WASD
Right Paw - Right trigger or IJKL
Start - Space or A
Exit - Escape or B

As mentioned, we drew on Cooking Mama as inspiration for the minigames and also the feedback that we could provide to the player.
Kate Inabinet provided us with the lovely punny name. Nat focused a lot on communicating to the player, both what was happening in the game
and what the goal is at anytime. This is done through text, sound, particles, outlines and object manipulation.
Alex drew on Nintendogs as inspiration for the texturing of the objects, particularly the dog logos on the ingredients.

Unfortunately the game is incomplete for a number of reasons. Ignoring Nat's focus on other projects/work, the missing section of the game is the
oven/baking, which is the one part that breaks away from the limited game space of the other sections. Putting the bread in to bake had to involve
picking up the bread, moving the player back, placing the bread in the oven and then some kind of animation of the bread emerging cooked. The
aftermath of this should have been the payoff for the players hard work. Alas the player gets a oven door falling off it's hinges to reveal a giant
bread that was hiding in the oven all along.

The game also lacks some sound effects, due to time constraints and our wanting to record them ourselves.
